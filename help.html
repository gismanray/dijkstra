<h2 style="text-align:center;">About The Dijstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</h2>
	<p>Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path in a graph (network) made of nodes and edges.  It was 
	published by Edsger Dijkstra ['daikstr&#601;] in 1959 and has been widely applied to transportation 
	and GIS since then. This web-based demonstration application was developed by Dr. Ray Huang. Although 
	named "shortest path", the algorithm can find paths that minimize any costs including distance, 
	time, money, etc. that are involved in traversing the edges and nodes in the graph.</p>
	
	<p>The Dijkstra's algorithm is a labelling algorithm. Basically, it is an iterative procedure that progressively labels 
			nodes and edges when it searches the graph and minimizes cumulative costs at nodes.  Given a
			graph <span class="equ">G = <span class="nor">(</span>N, E<span class="nor">)</span></span>, 
			<span class="equ">N = <span class="nor">{</span>x<span class="nor">}</span></span>, 
			<span class="equ">E = <span class="nor">{</span>e<span class="nor">}</span></span>, 
			where <span class="equ">N</span> and <span class="equ">E</span> represent a set of 
			nodes and edges respectively, the procedure below finds the shortest path 
			from an origin node <span class="equ">s <span class="nor">&#8712;</span> N</span> 
			to a destination node <span class="equ">t <span class="nor">&#8712;</span> N</span>.</p>
		   
	<p style="position: relative; width:635px; left:40px; text-indent:-40px;"><b>Step 1</b>: initially, all edges and 
			nodes are unlabeled.  Assign a number <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)
			</span></span> to each node <span class="equ">x</span> to denote the tentative length of the shortest 
			path from <span class="equ">s</span> to <span class="equ">x</span> that uses only labeled nodes as 
			intermediate nodes.  Initially, set <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>s<span class="nor">)
			</span> = 0</span> and <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)</span> = 
			&infin;</span> for all <span class="equ">x &#8800; s</span>.  Let <span class="equ">y</span> denote the last 
			node that was labeled. Label node <span class="equ">s</span> and let <span class="equ">y = s</span>.</p>
		   
	<p><b>Step 2</b>: for each unlabeled node <span class="equ">x</span>, redefine <span class="equ">d<span 
			class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)</span></span> as follows:</p>
		   
		   <p style="width:675px; text-align:center;"><span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span 
		   class="nor">)</span> = min<span class="nor">{</span>d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span 
			   class="nor">)</span>, d<span class="nor">(</span>y<span class="nor">)</span> + 
			   e<span class="nor">(</span>y, x<span class="nor">)}</span></span></p>
		   
		   <p style="width:635px; margin-left:40px;">This can be performed efficiently by scanning the 
			forward star of node <span class="equ">y</span> since only these nodes will be affected.  
			If <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)</span> = &infin;</span> 
			for all unlabeled nodes <span class="equ">x</span>, then stop because no path exists
			from <span class="equ">s</span> to any unlabeled node.  Otherwise, label the unlabeled node 
			with the smallest value of <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)</span></span>. 
			Also label the edge directed into node <span class="equ">x</span> from a labeled node that determined 
			the value of <span class="equ">d<span class="nor">(</span>x<span class="nor">)</span></span> 
			in the above minimization.  Let <span class="equ">y = x</span></p>

	<p style="position: relative; width:635px; left:40px; text-indent:-40px;"><b>Step 3</b>: if node 
			<span class="equ">t</span> has been labeled then stop, since a shortest path from <span 
			class="equ">s</span> to <span class="equ">t</span> has been discovered. This path consists of 
			the unique path of labeled edges from <span class="equ">s</span> to <span class="equ">t</span>.  
			If node <span class="equ">t</span> has not been labeled yet, repeat step 2.</p>

	<p>If you feel the math expression hard to apprehend, the following procedure may help. And the 
		procedure can be carried out with a piece of paper and a pencile. A graph 
		(network) is composed of a set of nodes that are connected by edges each carrying a traversal 
		cost (or length). To find the shortest path from an origin node to a destination node,</p>

	<p style="position: relative; width:635px; left:40px; text-indent:-40px;"><b>Step 1</b>: Assign a travel 
		cost 0 to the origin node and infinity (∞) to all the rest nodes. Then set the origin node as the 
		start node and begin the following iterative process.</p>

	<p style="position: relative; width:635px; left:40px; text-indent:-40px;"><b>Step 2</b>, If the start 
		node is the destination node, the shortest path is found, stop.</p>
		<p style="position:relative; left:40px;">Otherwise,</p>
	<p style="position:relative; width:615px; left:60px; text-indent:-20px;">1) For the start node, find all 
		its neighboring nodes that can be directly traveled to. Let's call them to-nodes.</p>
	<p style="position:relative; width:615px; left:60px; text-indent:-20px;">2) For each to-node, calculate 
		a cumulative cost by adding the cost at the start node and the cost of the edge between the start-node and the to-node.</p>
		<p style="position:relative; width:615px; left:60px;">If the to-node currently carries infinity, 
			label the node with the cumulative cost;</p>
		<p style="position:relative; width:615px; left:60px;">Otherwise (if the to-node carries 
			a cost, i.e., the node has been labelled), </p>
			<p style="position:relative; width:595px; left:80px;">if the new cumulative cost is
			smaller than the labeled cost at the to-node, relabel the to-node with the new cumulative cost;</p>
			<p style="position:relative; width:595px; left:80px;">otherwise (if the cumulative cost is 
			greater than or equal to the labeled cost at the to-node), just skip this to-node.</p>
		<!--p style="position:relative; width:595px; left:80px; text-indent:-20px;">b. If the to-node carries a</p-->
	<p style="position:relative; width:615px; left:60px; text-indent:-20px;">3)	Once all to-nodes from the 
		start node are labeled, close the start node and label the edge leading to the start node. This marks
		the end of an iteration of network search.</p>
	</p>
	<p style="position: relative; width:635px; left:40px; text-indent:-40px;"><b>Step 3</b>: Among all labelled 
		nodes (i.e., nodes carrying a cost but are not closed), find the one that carries the minimum 
		cost and set it as the start node, then repeat step 2. If no start node is found, i.e., all nodes are
		either closed or unlabeled, the entire network is searched through, stop.</p>


<h2 style="text-align:center;">How to Use The Dijkstra Algorithm Learning App</h2>
	
	<!--p>The algorithm may be performed using a pen and a piece of paper (although Dijkstra did not have
		them when he figured it out outside a coffee shop). Once you have drawn a graph, assign 0 (cost)
		to the origin node you choose and assign infinity to all the rest nodes. Optionally, you may also 
		specify a destination node.  To start a shortest path search, let the origin node to be the start 
		node and find out all nodes that can be traveled to from the start node. Then for each (to-)nodes 
		just found, label it with the cumulative costs, i.e. the sum of the cost at the start node and 
		the cost of the edge between them.  After labelling all to-nodes of a start node, highlight the 
		edge that leads to the start node (if it's not the origin) and close the start node, which marks 
		the end of a round of search. To start a new round, select the node that carries the minimum 
		cumulative cost among all labeled to-nodees	as a new start node and repeat the above search process. 
		While searching to-nodes from the start node, a labeled node can be relabelled if it is arrived 
		with a lower cumulative cost, but the start node and all closed nodes cannot be revisited. Once 
		the destination node (if specified) is selected as a start node, or when no new start node is 
		available, the search process stops and the shortest path(s) can be retrived by following the 
		highlighted edges.</p-->

	<p>This Dijkstra's algorithm learning app helps you understand the algorithm in a way similar to using 
		pen and paper, but more conveniently. When you open the page, an example graph is loaded. You can 
		use the select tool to relocate nodes by dragging them, and you can adjust the cost of edges by 
		dragging the slider on them.  To search the shortest path(s), you must use the set origin tool 
		to set an origin node before start, and you may or may not set a destination. Then you can click 
		the step over tool to move the algorithm step by step, or click the auto run tool once to run through. 
		Network search process is explained step-by-step in the lower box. The following briefly explains 
		the tools on the page.</p>
